            <h1 class="w3-center">The Issue here is that we need to make our cities safe for our future generation as 3.5 billion people live in the cities today and this number will continue to grow and as it grows the solutions to some of the basic needs of human life will be found in the city.  One of the biggest issues that sticks out is the inequality of our cities.  We cannot have 833 million people living in slums.  The reason why people today are living in slums is that cities only occupy 3% of earths land, but account for 60-80% of energy consumption.  We must create social stability without harming the enviorment.</h1>

               <h1>How Can We All Help?</h1>
               <p>My suggestion to those that want to help is to take an active involment in how the city is being governed and managed and if they are not doing something right, you can talk to them and put pressure on them to make change, and if they dont listen, vote them out.  What I believe is also important is the vision that the citizens have for their city such as making sure that the kids have a safe way of walking to school, also making sure that families can walk together at night without constantly worrying about their safety.</p>

  <h1>The Importance of Safety</h1>
  <p>See these people walking, these are the very people that walk through these cities every day and have to deal with the very issues that I discussed in this presentation such as the eneergy consumption as well as people living in slums with backed up traffic.  It doesn't matter if you are not affected by this very issue, if you believe that something is wrong with our cities, get up off your chair and do something about it, or else what would happen is some of your relatives could end up living in slums.</p>
